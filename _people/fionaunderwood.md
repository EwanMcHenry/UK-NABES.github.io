UK-NABES Workshop co-facilitator with Megan Towers & Harriet Low    

I currently work as an independent statistical consultant/researcher. I build statistical approaches to help inform decision making especially on the sustainable management of bioresources (e.g. deer, fish) and the (illegal) wildlife trade in the UK and overseas.    

I have experience of working as a statistician within or for (I)NGOs, (international) research organisations, universities and public sector bodies within the environmental, conservation, climate change and food security sectors.
