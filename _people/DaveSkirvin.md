Joint Technical Director of the Modelling, Software and Geospatial Sciences team in ADAS. Dave specialises in the development of models and tools to allow assessment and development of agricultural policy. This encompasses a wide range of aspects of agricultural production, including crop protection, diffuse pollution, biodiversity, land use and land use change. His interests include agricultural resource use efficiency modelling, land use and land use change modelling and crop protection modelling. 
He has significant experience in the development of models and software, having produced software tools for a range of clients including UK Government, levy bodies, UK agencies and global agrochemical companies. 
Dave currently manages the databases and code for the UK Greenhouse Gas and Ammonia Emission Inventory for Agriculture, and an API that provides the underpinning methodology as a reference methodology for calculation of emission at a farm scale. He also manages the database that underpins the Defra Survey of Crop Pests and Diseases.
Dave's current focus is on developing integrated tools to support decisions on farm and land management and the modelling the impacts of land-use change on the environment, particularly habitat creation & restoration and biodiversity impacts.
