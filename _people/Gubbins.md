Simon Gubbins is group leader in Transmission Biology at The Pirbright Institute. He has over 25 yearsâ€™ experience applying mathematical and statistical approaches to biological data. His main research interest is understanding the transmission of viral diseases of livestock across scales. This work explores the question of how the dynamics of viruses at one scale (for example, within an animal or within a farm) influence the dynamics at another scale (for example, between animals or between farms). A particular focus of his work is the epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue, integrating field and laboratory data for these diseases into mathematical frameworks that can be used to inform disease control policy.
