Landscape and population ecologist at The Woodland Trust and hon. research fellow at University of Manchester. Formerly freelance ecological research consultant and PhD researcher at University of Aberdeen and BioSS. 

Interested generally in figuring out and smoothing the continuum between applied quantitative research and effective on-the-ground conservation management, specifically in adaptive management and structured decision making.  

In my current role I do a fair amount of work on the functional connectivity of habiat, monitoring habitat condition, advising on species population managment and translocations, as well as a lot of miscelanious quantitative work: making use of often-messy data that we have access to and designing monitoring and survey work to answer questions relevent to the cause of woods and trees
