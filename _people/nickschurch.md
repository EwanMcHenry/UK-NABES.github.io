I joined BioSS as the Principal Statistician for Ecology & Environmental Science in 2019 and lead the Ecology and Environmental Science team at BioSS. In this role, I line manage four statisticians (who are primarily embedded with the James Hutton Institute at Craigiebuckler in Aberdeen), oversee and lead the teams consultancy collaborations (both external and as part of the current RESAS Strategic Research Programme), oversee the wider BioSS consultancy programmes with NatureScot and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, lead BioSS consultancy work on forensic science work, and supervise three PhD students working on applied environmental science & ecology problems, alongside working on my own personal research interests.
