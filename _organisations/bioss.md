BioSS specialises in the development and application of the quantitative methods needed to enhance scientific knowledge and impact.

Our vision is to improve science & society through an understanding of variation, uncertainty and risk.

Our mission is to develop and apply quantitative methodologies with a rigorous mathematical and statistical basis.

We are recognised internationally for our work at the interface between the mathematically-based sciences and a wide span of applied sciences covering agriculture and the rural economy, the environment, food and health.

Our principal funder is the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS).

We are one of the Scottish Environment, Food and Agriculture Research Institutes (SEFARI), working collectively to deliver a portfolio of strategic research and translational activities commissioned by RESAS.
