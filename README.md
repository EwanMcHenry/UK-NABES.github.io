# `UK-NABES`


## Some details about the site setup

The NABES website is hosted here. The site uses [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), a simple way to build a site using only [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) (plain text) files.

You can edit any page by simply clicking on it in this repository and clicking the edit button (pen icon, top right). If you have permissions this will lead you to be able to edit in situ, else you will be asked to "fork" the site, make changes then create a "pull request" to submit your changes back here for review.
