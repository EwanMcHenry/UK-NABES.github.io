Eleanor D'Arcy is a senior advisor in Statistics at the Environment Agency. She works on the Defra funded Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme. This is a science innovation and transformation programme set up to collect data on the extent, condition and change over time of England's land and water environments, as part of the UK government's commitment to leave the environment in a better state for future generations. Eleanor's interest lie with environmental and ecological statistics, particularly data integration, monitoring network design and statistical modelling.

Eleanor completed her PhD at Lancaster University on 'Extreme value methods for protecting and maintaining critical infrastructure from natural hazards' which was in collaboration with EDF Energy. She is passionate about cross-disciplinary collaboration with academia, industry and the public sector. Eleanor also enjoys outreach activities to inspire the next generation of statisticians and challenge preconceptions about what it means to be a mathematician. In 2023/24 she was a William Guy lecturer for the Royal Statistical Society, where she delivered lectures across the UK on 'How can statistics protect us against extreme sea levels resulting from climate change?'
